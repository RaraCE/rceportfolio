      <div class ="quote"> "Things are impossible until they are not." -<i>Cpt. Picard, Star Trek</i> </div>
        <div class="intro"> Most of my research was part of my studies at NAU or ERAU (Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University) while I was getting my undergraduate degree. Two major areas included
        nanoscience and astronomy. Each one resulted in published papers. </div>
        
        <div class="nano"> <h2>Nanoscience</h2>
            <ul>
              <p>Two areas were the focus of my research, which included <i>the self-</i></p>
              <p><i>assembly of active magnetic micro- and nano- structures</i>, and <i>shape-</i></p>
              <p><i>dependent motion of structured photoactive microswimmers</i>.</p>

              <p>The first study had to do with learning how to control the direction of</p>
              <p>the microparticles through the use of magnetic fields, generated by</p>
              <p>copper coils. And then have them self-assembly.</p>

              <p>In the next experiment, we focused on the geometry of the</p>
              <p>microparticles and used UV light as a reactive agent. It was more</p>
              <p>promising and potentially a safer delivery system than previous</p>
              <p>attempts. The end result was published through the Applied Materials &</p>
              <p>Interfaces journal. Which can be viewed by clicking this <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.8b01940"> link </a>.</p>

        <div class="astro"> <h2>Astronomy</h2>
            <ul>
              <p>Our team studied the data collected from the Kepler satellite to</p>
              <p>determine characteristics of certain stars. Our findings were presented at the</p>
              <p>American Astronomical Society in 2012 as <i>Stellar Variability Survey of Kepler</i></p>
              <p><i>Mission Data</i>.</p>

              <p>The propose was to study Kepler Mission data releases in survey form to</p>
              <p>determine the variability and nature of stars within the mission field. During a</p>
              <p>time frame allotted for this project, we individually studied the light curves,</p>
              <p>frequency domain and phase plots of 200 stars to better categorize the nature</p>
              <p>of their potential variability. Our research focused on a random sample of 200</p>
              <p>Main Sequence dwarf stars (class V luminosity). Determining the periodicity</p>
              <p>of such stars will provide a basis for later comparison against light curves</p>
              <p>identified as potential planetary transits.</p>
