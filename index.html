        <div class="aboutme1"> Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Ra'Shae - I have a background in physics, a passion for storytelling, and a love for learning. 
            <br>I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and moved often during my early years before settling in Oregon in my late twenties. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Physics from Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona in 2016.
            <br>Since then, I've explored a wide range of industries including retail, scientific research, semiconductor manufacturing, and freelance creative work. 
            My curiosity and love of learning have led me to pursue additional studies in computer programming and data science. Today, my work spans several fields-voice acting, visual art, writing, coding, 
            and more-because I've never felt drawn to just one path. Instead, I've chosen to embrace them all.
            Whether I'm painting a custom portrait, narrating an audiobook, building a website, or writing a novel, I bring creativity, dedication, and a love for the craft to everything I do.  
            <br> This portfolio is where all my passions come together. Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate.</div>
